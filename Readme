Data Preparation: Working Data Creation: Duplicated the Employees sheet into a new tab called Working_Data. All transformations & analysis were done only on Working_Data. Original raw data remained untouched.

Level Mapping (Designation - Level):
Purpose: Ensure each employee has a standardized level (L1 - L8).
Formula used: =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(H2, Level_Map!A:B, 2, FALSE), "")

Business Unit Mapping (Function - BU)
Purpose: Categorize employees into Business Units.
Formula used: =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(I2, Function_BU_Map!A:B, 2, FALSE), "")

Status Flag (Active vs Exited)
Purpose: Identify current employees vs exited employees.
Logic if Working then active else Relieved then Exited.
Formula: =IF(G2="Working","Active","Exited")

Join Quarter (Derived Column)
Purpose: Enable quarterly analysis of joiners.
Formula: ="Q"&ROUNDUP(MONTH(C2)/3,0)&" "&YEAR(C2)

Exit Quarter (Derived Column)
Purpose: Track exit timing while keeping active employees blank.
Formula: =IF(O2="","", "Q"&ROUNDUP(MONTH(O2)/3,0)&" "&YEAR(O2))

Charts Included: Joiners vs Exits overall, Headcount Trend by Function & Level - 2024, Attrition Rate Trend overall.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates: Strong data preparation, Correct people analytics metrics, Clear business interpretation, Ready reporting.
